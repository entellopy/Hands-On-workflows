### Context
A mid-sized fashion retailer receives hundreds of customer feedback entries each month through its CRM system. These include product reviews, service complaints, and suggestions, mostly in free-text format. 
Initially, the company used Excel to manually tag and summarize feedback, but this approach became inefficient and inconsistent as volume grew.

This business problem requires Python to automated this time-consuming task and avoid manual errors.

## Takeaway
This case shows how businesses can start with Excel, then scale up with Python to unlock deeper insights. Even beginner-level Python can automate repetitive tasks, reduce bias, and reveal patterns that manual methods miss. 
Excel is useful until certain threshold, once you reach it, your analysis needs to evolve.
